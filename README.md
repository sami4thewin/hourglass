HourGlass

HourGlass is a Rails based app that tries to tackle the age old issue of procrastination.

How does it attempt to accomplish that?

By safely and securely storing your links, videos, and lists...for a designated period of time.
After said period, HourGlass deletes your content.

This should, in theory, encourage you to keep up with your content that you feel is important.
Otherwise you risk losing it.
